# k84

"keighty-four"

## influences

Based heavily on [``metalliqaz``'s Epsilon keyboard](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=41390.0).

## characteristics

- 70% layout
- powered by a teensy2
- layered case/body

I want to have as many keys as possible for gaming purposes while maintaining a compact size.
The size of the Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro is nice for typing/programming, but having to chord keys during games isn't a trivial task.
Keeping the arrow keys and the function row is important, which throws out pretty much all 60% designs.
I also want to incorporate some layout cues from the HHKb, namely its backspace location.
I initially thought that I wouldn't like that, but now I do.

## keycaps

I'm heavily eyeing Signature Plastics' [SA Symbiosis keycap set](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-symbiosis-keycap-set/). I'd need to contact them about a couple caps though as they don't have every cap listed that I want for the k84.
